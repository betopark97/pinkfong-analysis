Example of Application  
  
If you’re focusing on content analysis:  
	1.	Break down content by themes (e.g., educational, entertaining).  
	2.	Compare performance metrics (views, engagement rate) across themes.  
	3.	Identify gaps (e.g., underperforming themes or untapped categories).  
  
For engagement analysis:  
	1.	Calculate engagement rates for each video.  
	2.	Perform A/B tests on thumbnails for low-engagement videos.
